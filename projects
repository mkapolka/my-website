I made this goofy little game for a <a href="http://glorioustrainwrecks.com">Glorious Trainwrecks</a> 
 Klik of the Month Klub event. It's a fighting game that pits two furious lovers against
 each other in a french kiss standoff.
 It was featured at <a href="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/?p=1817">Anna Anthropy's
 tent at Indiecade</a> and also in <a href="http://gdmag.com/blog/2012/11/the-avant-game.php">

MFA Prep Course is a game about living the life of an art school undergrad,
 made in collaboration with <a href="artfail.org">John Bruneau</a>. It debuted
 in the <a href="http://www.workssanjose.org/wordpress/">Works Gallery</a>
 annual member's show to rabid enthusiasm from the luderati and confusion from
 the dusty art historians, and has since been updated for a web release.

Have Fun was made for my BFA project at SJSU. 
It is a point and click adventure game set in the future when gamification
 has become a ubiquitous cultural institution. It uses <a href="http://flixel.org">Flixel</a>
 and an entity/component framework that I built for Flash.

This is a very simple WebGL-powered tree generator that I made as an exercise while learning WebGL.
 It generates black and white trees that rotate pleasantly.

This game is completely normal and not at all an experiment in surrealism.

This one is a platformer that is about my beefs with some of the trends of contemporary
 game development, especially as it relates to art games. It was also the first game
 I made with my entity/component framework, and although the framework was pretty much
 overkill it worked very well.

This was for the Asynchronous Game Development Challenge for the game development
 club.  The idea was that in the first phase, a designer would create a design
 document for a game, and in the second phase artists and programmers would
 implement it.  The design for this game was created by David Do, the in-game
 art was made by Andrew Dakhil, and the programming, level design, and intro and
 outro art were done by me.
 <br><br>
 The idea is that you are a defenseless character in a frozen post-apocalyptic
 wasteland where polar bears rule the land.  The bears, who are perfectly white,
 are invisible against the white snow, and you are slowly freezing to death when
 you stray away from the safety of the fire.  The combination of these two
 mechanics creates an interesting tension when you are forced to throw yourself
 blindly into the snow, going slow enough to dodge any bears that present
 themselves but fast enough that you don't freeze.

This is a quick game I made for a Flash game development class I took when I was
 at SJSU. It is about a student who gets way to into the internet, to the point
 that it start to effect how they interact with the world around them.
